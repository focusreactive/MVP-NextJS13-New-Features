# Data Fetching

> **Good to know**:
>
> - This new data fetching model is currently being developed by the React team. We recommend reading the [support for promises React RFC](https://github.com/acdlite/rfcs/blob/first-class-promises/text/0000-first-class-support-for-promises.md) which introduces `async` and `await` in Server Components and a new `use()` hook for Client Components.
> - While you can try it out, it is not yet stable. We'll keep these docs updated to reflect the latest developments.

React extends `fetch` to provide [automatic request deduping](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching#automatic-fetch-request-deduping), and Next.js extends the `fetch` options object to allow each request to set its own [caching and revalidating](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching).

## [`async` and `await` in Server Components](#async-and-await-in-server-components)

With the [proposed React RFC](https://github.com/acdlite/rfcs/blob/first-class-promises/text/0000-first-class-support-for-promises.md), you can use `async` and `await` to fetch data in Server Components.

app/page.tsx

```ts
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/...');
  // The return value is *not* serialized
  // You can return Date, Map, Set, etc.

  // Recommendation: handle errors
  if (!res.ok) {
    // This will activate the closest `error.js` Error Boundary
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch data');
  }

  return res.json();
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData();

  return <main></main>;
}
```

### [Server Component Functions](#server-component-functions)

Next.js provides helpful server functions you may need when fetching data in Server Components:

- [`cookies()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies)
- [`headers()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers)

## [`use` in Client Components](#use-in-client-components)

`use` is a new React function that **accepts a promise** conceptually similar to `await`. `use` **handles the promise** returned by a function in a way that is compatible with components, hooks, and Suspense. Learn more about `use` in the [React RFC](https://github.com/acdlite/rfcs/blob/first-class-promises/text/0000-first-class-support-for-promises.md#usepromise).

Wrapping `fetch` in `use` is currently **not** recommended in Client Components and may trigger multiple re-renders. For now, if you need to fetch data in a Client Component, we recommend using a third-party library such as [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) or [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4).

> **Note:** We'll be adding more examples once `fetch` and `use` work in Client Components.

## [Static Data Fetching](#static-data-fetching)

By default, `fetch` will automatically fetch and [cache data](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching) indefinitely.

```ts
fetch('https://...'); // cache: 'force-cache' is the default
```

### [Revalidating Data](#revalidating-data)

To revalidate [cached data](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching) at a timed interval, you can use the `next.revalidate` option in `fetch()` to set the `cache` lifetime of a resource (in seconds).

```ts
fetch('https://...', { next: { revalidate: 10 } });
```

See [Revalidating Data](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/revalidating) for more information.

> **NOTE:** Caching at the fetch level via `revalidate` or `cache: 'force-cache'` stores the data across requests in a shared cache. You should avoid using it for user specific data (i.e. requests that derive data from `cookies()` or `headers()`)

## [Dynamic Data Fetching](#dynamic-data-fetching)

To fetch fresh data on every `fetch` request, use the `cache: 'no-store'` option.

```ts
fetch('https://...', { cache: 'no-store' });
```

## [Data Fetching without `fetch()`](#data-fetching-without-fetch)

### [Default Caching Behavior](#default-caching-behavior)

Any data fetching libraries that do not use `fetch` directly **will not** affect caching of a route, and will be static or dynamic depending on the route segment.

If the segment is static (default), the output of the request will be cached and revalidated (if configured) alongside the rest of the segment. If the segment is dynamic, the output of the request will _not_ be cached and will be re-fetched on every request when the segment is rendered.

> **Good to know:** Dynamic functions like [`cookies()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies) and [`headers()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers) will make the route segment dynamic.

### [Segment Cache Configuration](#segment-cache-configuration)

As a temporary solution, until the caching behavior of third-party queries can be configured, you can use [segment configuration](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#configrevalidate) to customize the cache behavior of the entire segment.

app/page.tsx

```ts
import prisma from './lib/prisma';

export const revalidate = 3600; // revalidate every hour

async function getPosts() {
  const posts = await prisma.post.findMany();
  return posts;
}

export default async function Page() {
  const posts = await getPosts();
  // ...
}
```
