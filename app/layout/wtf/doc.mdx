Nested layouts missing information about previous segments
We can only pass the full path to the Link component

# useSelectedLayoutSegments

`useSelectedLayoutSegments` is a **Client Component** hook that lets you read the active route segments **below** the Layout it is called from.

It is useful for creating UI in parent Layouts that need knowledge of active child segments such as breadcrumbs.

app/example-client-component.tsx

```ts
'use client';

import { useSelectedLayoutSegments } from 'next/navigation';

export default function ExampleClientComponent() {
  const segments = useSelectedLayoutSegments();

  return (
    <ul>
      {segments.map((segment, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{segment}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

**Good to know:**

- Since `useSelectedLayoutSegments` is a [Client Component](/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#client-components) hook, and Layouts are [Server Components](/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#server-components) by default, `useSelectedLayoutSegments` is usually called via a Client Component that is imported into a Layout.
- The returned segments include [Route Groups](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes#route-groups), which you might not want to be included in your UI. You can use the `filter()` array method to remove items that start with a bracket.

## [Parameters](#parameters)

```ts
const segments = useSelectedLayoutSegments();
```

`useSelectedLayoutSegments` does not take any parameters.

## [Returns](#returns)

`useSelectedLayoutSegments` returns an array of strings containing the active segments one level down from the layout the hook was called from. Or an empty array if none exist.

For example, given the Layouts and URLs below, the returned segments would be:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Layout</th>
      <th>Visited URL</th>
      <th>Returned Segments</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>app/layout.js</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>/</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>[]</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>app/layout.js</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>/dashboard</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>['dashboard']</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>app/layout.js</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>/dashboard/settings</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>['dashboard', 'settings']</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>app/dashboard/layout.js</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>/dashboard</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>[]</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>app/dashboard/layout.js</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>/dashboard/settings</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>['settings']</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

[Not-found page does not work in next.js 13](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75302340/not-found-page-does-not-work-in-next-js-13)

app/layout/[...not_found]/page.tsx

```ts
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation';

export default function NotFoundCatchAll() {
  notFound();
}
```

app/layout/not-found.tsx

```ts
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function NotFound() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Not found â€“ 404!</h1>
      <div>
        <Link href="/">Go back to Home</Link>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

# not-found.js

The **not-found** file is used to render UI when the [`notFound`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/not-found) function is thrown within a route segment.

app/blog/not-found.tsx

```ts
export default function NotFound() {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Not Found</h2>
      <p>Could not find requested resource</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

> **Note:** In addition to catching expected `notFound()` errors, the root `app/not-found.js` file also handles any unmatched URLs for your whole application. This means users that visit a URL that is not handled by your app will be shown the UI exported by the `app/not-found.js` file.

## [Props](#props)

`not-found.js` components do not accept any props.
