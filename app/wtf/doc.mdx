[no props](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-selected-layout-segment)
[with props](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes#useselectedlayoutsegments)

- Using the [`searchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#searchparams-optional) [Pages](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page) prop will opt the page into dynamic rendering at request time.

unstable cache

---

build information can show it's static when it's actually SSR, `no-cache`, `no-store` can make a page SSR even with `force-static`

---

POST is cached by default

[Not-found page does not work in next.js 13](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75302340/not-found-page-does-not-work-in-next-js-13)

app/layout/[...not_found]/page.tsx

```ts
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation';

export default function NotFoundCatchAll() {
  notFound();
}
```

app/layout/not-found.tsx

```ts
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function NotFound() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Not found â€“ 404!</h1>
      <div>
        <Link href="/">Go back to Home</Link>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

# not-found.js

The **not-found** file is used to render UI when the [`notFound`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/not-found) function is thrown within a route segment.

app/blog/not-found.tsx

```ts
export default function NotFound() {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Not Found</h2>
      <p>Could not find requested resource</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

> **Note:** In addition to catching expected `notFound()` errors, the root `app/not-found.js` file also handles any unmatched URLs for your whole application. This means users that visit a URL that is not handled by your app will be shown the UI exported by the `app/not-found.js` file.

## [Props](#props)

`not-found.js` components do not accept any props.
