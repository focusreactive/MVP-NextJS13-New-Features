Data fetching:
where(Server, Client), when(buildtime, runtime), how(layout, page, component)

Simple static - Blog
auto switch to dynamic with parallel routes - Dashboard
WTF - Static dashboard

Dynamic functions: cookies(), headers(), useSearchParams(), searchParams Pages prop

If any fetch requests in the route use the revalidate option, the route will be re-rendered statically during revalidation.

## [The `app` Directory](#the-app-directory)

In version 13, Next.js introduced a new **App Router** built on [React Server Components](/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#server-components), which supports shared layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more.

The App Router works in a new directory named `app`. The `app` directory works alongside the `pages` directory to allow for incremental adoption. This allows you to opt some routes of your application into the new behavior while keeping other routes in the `pages` directory for previous behavior.

> **Good to know:** The App Router takes priority over the Pages Router. Routes across directories should not resolve to the same URL path and will cause a build-time error to prevent a conflict.

By default, components inside `app` are [React Server Components](/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#server-components). This is a performance optimization and allows you to easily adopt them, and you can also use [Client Components](/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#client-components).

## [Roles of Folders and Files](#roles-of-folders-and-files)

In the App Router:

- **Folders** are used to define routes. A route is a single path of nested folders, following the hierarchy from the **root folder** down to a final **leaf folder** that includes a `page.js` file.
- **Files** are used to create UI that is shown for the route segment. See [special files](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#file-conventions).

## [File Conventions](#file-conventions)

Next.js provides a set of special files to create UI with specific behavior in nested routes:

- [page.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#pages): Create the unique UI of a route and make the path publicly accessible.
  - [route.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/router-handlers): Create server-side API endpoints for a route.
- [layout.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#layouts): Create shared UI for a segment and its children. A layout wraps a page or child segment.
  - [template.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#templates): Similar to `layout.js`, except a new component instance is mounted on navigation. Use layouts unless you need this behavior.
- [loading.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming): Create loading UI for a segment and its children. `loading.js` wraps a page or child segment in a [React Suspense Boundary](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense#suspense), showing the loading UI while they load.
- [error.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling): Create error UI for a segment and its children. `error.js` wraps a page or child segment in a [React Error Boundary](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html), showing the error UI if an error is caught.
  - [global-error.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling): Similar to `error.js`, but specifically for catching errors in the root `layout.js`.
- [not-found.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/not-found): Create UI to show when the [`notFound`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/not-found) function is thrown within a route segment or when a URL is not matched by any route.

## [Component Hierarchy](#component-hierarchy)

The React components defined in special files of a route segment are rendered in a specific hierarchy:

- `layout.js`
- `template.js`
- `error.js` (React error boundary)
- `loading.js` (React suspense boundary)
- `not-found.js` (React error boundary)
- `page.js` or nested `layout.js`

![Component Hierarchy for File Conventions](/assets/file-conventions-component-hierarchy.avif)
In a nested route, the components of a segment will be nested **inside** the components of its parent segment.

## [Colocation](#colocation)

In addition to special files, you have the option to colocate your own files inside folders. For example, stylesheets, tests, components, and more.

## [Server-Centric Routing with Client-side Navigation](#server-centric-routing-with-client-side-navigation)

Unlike the `pages` directory which uses client-side routing, the App Router uses **server-centric routing** to align with [Server Components](/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#server-components) and [data fetching on the server](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching). With server-centric routing, the client does not have to download a route map and the same request for Server Components can be used to look up routes. This optimization is useful for all applications, but has a larger impact on applications with many routes.

Although routing is server-centric, the router uses **client-side navigation** with the [Link Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/NavLinking-and-navigating#linking) - resembling the behavior of a Single-Page Application. This means when a user navigates to a new route, the browser will not reload the page. Instead, the URL will be updated and Next.js will [only render the segments that change](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#partial-rendering).

Additionally, as users navigate around the app, the router will store the result of the React Server Component payload in an **in-memory client-side cache**. The cache is split by route segments which allows invalidation at any level and ensures consistency across [React's concurrent renders](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18#what-is-concurrent-react). This means that for certain cases, the cache of a previously fetched segment can be re-used, further improving performance.

## [Partial Rendering](#partial-rendering)

When navigating between sibling routes (e.g. `/dashboard/settings` and `/dashboard/analytics` below), Next.js will only fetch and render the layouts and pages in routes that change. It will **not** re-fetch or re-render anything above the segments in the subtree. This means that in routes that share a layout, the layout will be preserved when a user navigates between sibling pages.

![How partial rendering works](/assets/partial-rendering.avif)

Without partial rendering, each navigation would cause the full page to re-render on the server. Rendering only the segment thatâ€™s updating reduces the amount of data transferred and execution time, leading to improved performance.

## [Advanced Routing Patterns](#advanced-routing-patterns)

The App Router also provides a set conventions to help you implement more advanced routing patterns. These include:

- [Parallel Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes): Allow you to simultaneously show two or more pages in the same view that can be navigated independently. You can use them for split views that have their own sub-navigation. E.g. Dashboards.
- [Intercepting Routes](https://nextjs.orghttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/intercepting-routes): Allow you to intercept a route and show it in the context of another route. You can use these when keeping the context for the current page is important. E.g. Seeing all tasks while editing one task or expanding a photo in a feed.
