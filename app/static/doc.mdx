auto switch to dynamic with parallel routes

# Static and Dynamic Rendering

In Next.js, a route can be statically or dynamically rendered.

- In a **static** route, components are rendered on the server at build time. The result of the work is cached and reused on subsequent requests.
- In a **dynamic** route, components are rendered on the server at request time.

## [Static Rendering (Default)](#static-rendering-default)

Static rendering (default) improves performance because all the rendering work is done ahead of time and can be served from a Content Delivery Network (CDN) geographically closer to the user.

You can opt into dynamic rendering by using a [dynamic function](https://nextjs.orghttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/static-and-dynamic-rendering#using-dynamic-functions) or [dynamic data fetching](https://nextjs.orghttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering#dynamic-data-fetches) in a layout or page. This will cause Next.js to render the whole route dynamically, at request time.

This table summarizes how [dynamic functions](https://nextjs.orghttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/static-and-dynamic-rendering#using-dynamic-functions) and [static data fetching (caching)](https://nextjs.orghttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/static-and-dynamic-rendering#static-data-fetching-default) affect the rendering behavior of a route.

Note how, for a route to be statically rendered, the data requests are **cached** and there are **no dynamic functions**.

**Note:** In the future, Next.js will introduce hybrid server-side rendering where layouts and pages in a route can be independently statically or dynamically rendered, instead of the whole route.

## [Static Data Fetching (Default)](#static-data-fetching-default)

By default, Next.js will cache the result of `fetch()` requests that do not specifically opt out of caching behavior. This means that fetch requests that do not set a `cache` option will use the `force-cache` option.

If any fetch requests in the route use the `revalidate` option, the route will be re-rendered statically during revalidation.

To learn more about caching data fetching requests, see the [Caching and Revalidating](https://nextjs.orghttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching) page.

## [Dynamic Rendering](#dynamic-rendering)

During static rendering, if a dynamic function or a dynamic `fetch()` request (no caching) is discovered, Next.js will switch to dynamically rendering the whole route at request time. Any cached data requests can still be re-used during dynamic rendering.

### [Using Dynamic Functions](#using-dynamic-functions)

Dynamic functions rely on information that can only be known at request time such as a user's cookies, current requests headers, or the URL's search params. In Next.js, these dynamic functions are:

- Using [`cookies()`](https://nextjs.orghttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies) or [`headers()`](https://nextjs.orghttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers) in a Server Component will opt the whole route into dynamic rendering at request time.
- Using [`useSearchParams()`](https://nextjs.orghttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-params) in Client Components will skip static rendering and instead render all client components up to the nearest parent Suspense boundary on the client.
  - We recommend wrapping the client component that uses `useSearchParams()` in a `<Suspense/>` boundary. This will allow any client components above it to be statically rendered. [Example](https://nextjs.orghttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-params#static-rendering).
- Using the [`searchParams`](https://nextjs.orghttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#searchparams-optional) [Pages](https://nextjs.orghttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page) prop will opt the page into dynamic rendering at request time.

### [Using Dynamic Data Fetches](#using-dynamic-data-fetches)

Dynamic data fetches are `fetch()` requests that specifically opt out of caching behavior by setting the `cache` option to `'no-store'` or `revalidate` to `0`.

The caching options for all `fetch` requests in a layout or page can also be set using the [segment config](https://nextjs.orghttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config) object.
